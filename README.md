transform_image performs shearing, scaling, rotation and translation

composite_image uses the fourier transform to extract a phase only and magnitude only reconstruction of an image. Then it creates a composite image with the phase of image A and the magnitude of image B and vice versa

reprojection_image Takes an image and a camera center and reprojects the image from the camera center.
